# Bullying Counselling Chatbot

## Introduction 

Teasing and bullying are seen as serious issues that can cause psychological damage in those on the receiving end. 
Bullying is extremely hard on children. Their grades can suffer, as can their physical and mental health. Many children who are bullied on a regular basis become afraid to go to school and some children have committed or attempted to commit suicide when bullying became too overwhelming. However, these struggles may not be clearly seen by parents, guardians, and educators.

The current prototype is an Emotional Health Assistant chatbot that provides emotional support to children who are prone to bullying and who are victims of depression, anxiety and trauma. 

The solution aims to provide a solution to address these challenges by developing an Emotional Health Assistant and Counselling app for children to support victims of bullying and harassment through counselling and facilitate reporting of abuse. Using Artificial Intelligence (AI) with chatbots the app will support victims of bullying and/or harassment by providing a healthy counselling approach and also facilitate reporting of abuse. 

## Scope

•	Helpful in providing treatment for those who are uncomfortable disclosing their feelings to a human being.

•	Virtual counselling provided by a chatbot is effective for those reluctant to speak with a therapist.

•	Saves users from spending money for appointments with a counsellor or therapist.

•	With Emotional Intelligence, chatbots can perform almost every job an expert can, without getting tired.

•	Offers users round the clock support.

•	Automate tasks which are to be done frequently and at the right time

## Data Sources

The initial prototype – is a simple Emotional Health Assistant Chatbot that is developed using datasets collected from GitHub. The sample data used to train the chatbot was gathered from counselchat data (https://github.com/nbertagnolli/counsel-chat/tree/master/data) from the GitHub repository that consists of  details such as a unique question identifier which is distinct for every question , the title of the question on counsel chat, the body of the individual’s question to counsellors, a URL to the last location of that question, the topic of the question, the summary of each therapist, a link to the therapist’s bio on counselchat, and finally the therapist response to the question. 

However, in order to train the chatbot, we have used/filtered only 3 fields - The title of the question on counsel, the topic of the question and the therapist response to the question that focuses on topics such as depression, children-adolescents, anxiety and trauma.
